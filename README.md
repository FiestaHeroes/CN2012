## Requirements

Minimum requirements for hosting and building your own server. For further details on setting up a server, please refer to our [documentation](https://doc.fiestaheroes.com/).

```bash
# Supported Operating Systems
- Windows Server: 2016, 2019, 2022, 2025
- Windows: 10, 11

# Minimum Hardware Specifications
To ensure optimal performance, we recommend the following minimum hardware specifications:
- RAM: 16GB
- CPU: 4 cores / 4 threads
- Disk: 128GB

Please note that although the minimum storage requirement for the operating system can technically be lower, we highly recommend a minimum of 128GB for optimal performance.

You can also utilize newer installations of Microsoft SQL Server, provided that the version is equal to or greater than 2019.
